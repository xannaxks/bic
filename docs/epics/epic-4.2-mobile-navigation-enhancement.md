## Status
Completed

## Priority
High

## Description
Enhance the mobile navigation overlay to include dropdown/accordion menus matching the desktop navigation structure. Currently, mobile navigation exists but lacks the detailed university navigation structure with expandable sub-menus. This epic will implement collapsible accordion menus for mobile that contain the same content as the desktop version.

## Business Value
- Provides mobile users with the same comprehensive navigation as desktop users
- Improves mobile user experience with organized, collapsible menu structure
- Ensures feature parity between desktop and mobile navigation
- Enables mobile users to discover all university departments, programs, and services
- Critical for mobile-first users (60%+ of university website traffic)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Mobile navigation contains all 5 main categories (About TU, Admission, Academics, Special Joint Program, International Student Support)
- [x] Each category expands/collapses to reveal sub-menu items
- [x] Sub-menu items match desktop navigation content exactly (37 total routes)
- [x] Smooth animations for expand/collapse interactions (200ms CSS transitions)
- [x] Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44px enforced)
- [x] Mobile menu design integrated with existing navigation system
- [x] Keyboard accessible via Radix UI Accordion
- [x] No build errors or TypeScript issues (dev server compiles successfully)
- [x] QA testing completed - 46/46 tests passed (100% pass rate)

- Story 4.2.1: Implement Mobile Navigation Accordion Menus

## Technical Approach
- Use Radix UI Accordion component for expandable sections
- Maintain current Sheet overlay component for mobile menu
- Implement smooth height transitions for accordion expand/collapse
- Use same navigation data structure as desktop (shared constants)
- Icons: ChevronDown/ChevronUp for expand/collapse indicators
- Preserve theme support (dark/light mode)
- Preserve language switching integration

## Timeline
- Start Date: 2025-01-18
- Estimated Duration: 1 day

## Dependencies
- Epic 4.0 (completed) - Desktop navigation structure
- Epic 4.1 (completed) - Navigation content

- Radix UI Accordion component

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking existing mobile menu functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Preserve Sheet overlay structure, add accordion within existing container
- **Risk**: Performance issues with many accordion items
  - **Mitigation**: Use Radix UI's optimized Accordion component, test on low-end devices
- **Risk**: Touch targets too small on mobile
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce 44px minimum touch target height
- **Risk**: Accordion animation causing layout shifts
  - **Mitigation**: Use CSS transitions with proper overflow handling

## Technical Requirements
- Minimum touch target: 44px height
- Animation duration: 200-300ms
- Support for iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Test on viewport widths: 320px, 375px, 414px, 768px

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 37 sub-menu items present and accessible
- [x] Accordion expand/collapse animations smooth (200ms transitions)
- [x] Touch targets meet 44px minimum
- [x] Code architecture reviewed (shared constants, clean components)
- [x] WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance verified
- [x] QA approval granted (46/46 tests passed)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite created (11 unit tests)
- [x] Build succeeds without errors (dev server ✓)
- [x] Documentation complete (epic, story, QA report)
