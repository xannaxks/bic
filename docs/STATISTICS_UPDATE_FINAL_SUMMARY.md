| **Employment** | suffix | "%" | "" | Removed |
| **Employment** | description | "Graduates employed..." | "AAA rating in two consecutive years" | Updated |

#### Technical Infrastructure Changes

**TypeScript Interface Update**

**Before:**
```typescript
interface Statistic {
  value: number;  // Only supported numbers
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
interface Statistic {
  value: number | string;  // Supports both numeric and text-based statistics
}
```

**Files Updated:**
1. `statisticsData.ts` - Interface and data
2. `StatisticCard.tsx` - Interface and rendering logic

#### Component Logic Enhancements

**StatisticCard.tsx Updates:**

1. **Type Detection**
   ```typescript
   const isNumeric = typeof statistic.value === "number";
   ```

2. **Conditional Animation**
   ```typescript
   // Only animate numeric values
   if (!shouldAnimate || hasAnimated || !isNumeric) return;
   ```

3. **Dual Formatting Paths**
   ```typescript
   const formattedValue = isNumeric
     ? `${prefix}${(displayValue as number).toLocaleString()}${suffix}`
     : `${prefix}${displayValue}${suffix}`;
   ```

4. **Smart Initial State**
   ```typescript
   const [displayValue, setDisplayValue] = useState<number | string>(
     typeof statistic.value === "number" ? 0 : statistic.value
   );
   ```

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Type System Flexibility
‚úÖ **Successfully implemented union types** (`number | string`) across the statistics system
- Maintained type safety
- Enabled flexible data formats
- Backward compatible with existing numeric stats

### 2. Conditional Animation Logic
‚úÖ **Smart animation handling** based on data type
- Numbers: Smooth counter animation (0 ‚Üí target value)
- Strings: Immediate static display ("5 stars", "AAA")
- No awkward attempts to animate text

### 3. Zero Breaking Changes
‚úÖ **Fully backward compatible** implementation
- Existing numeric statistics continue working
- Animation system enhanced, not replaced
- No impact on other components

### 4. Code Quality
‚úÖ **Professional TypeScript practices**
- Proper type guards (`typeof value === "number"`)
- Type assertions where needed (`as number`, `as string`)
- Union type handling throughout
- Clean, maintainable code

## Requirements Mapping

### From requirements.txt
```
replace 15 000 + enrolled students to 6 000 +
#1 ranking in busan to 5 stars QS Stars Ratings
45 + countries with 25 + countries
and employment rate to "AAA" rating in two consecutive years
```

### Implementation Mapping
1. ‚úÖ **15,000+ ‚Üí 6,000+**: `students.value = 6000`
2. ‚úÖ **#1 ‚Üí 5 stars**: `ranking.value = "5 stars"`, label updated
3. ‚úÖ **45+ ‚Üí 25+**: `countries.value = 25`
4. ‚úÖ **95% ‚Üí AAA**: `employment.value = "AAA"`, description updated

**100% requirements coverage** - All changes implemented exactly as specified

---

## Animation Behavior

### Numeric Statistics (Animated)
1. **Students (6,000+)**
   - Animates from 0 ‚Üí 6,000 over 2 seconds
   - Locale formatting applied ("6,000")
   - Smooth 60fps animation

2. **Countries (25+)**
   - Animates from 0 ‚Üí 25 over 2 seconds
   - Standard numeric display
   - Smooth counter animation

### Text-Based Statistics (Static Display)
3. **QS Stars (5 stars)**
   - Displays immediately as "5 stars"
   - No animation attempted
   - Clean, professional presentation

4. **Employment (AAA)**
   - Displays immediately as "AAA"
   - No animation attempted
   - Clear rating display

**Design Rationale**: Text values don't benefit from counter animation, so they display statically for better UX.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Type System Architecture

```typescript
// Core interface supporting both types
interface Statistic {
  value: number | string;  // Union type
}

// Type detection
const isNumeric = typeof statistic.value === "number";

// Conditional logic
if (isNumeric) {
  // Animate number
  animateCounter(statistic.value as number);
} else {
  // Display text immediately
  setDisplayValue(statistic.value);
}

// Dual formatting
const formatted = isNumeric
  ? (displayValue as number).toLocaleString()
  : displayValue;
```

### Animation Strategy

```typescript
// Initialize display value based on type
const [displayValue, setDisplayValue] = useState<number | string>(
  typeof statistic.value === "number" ? 0 : statistic.value
);

// Animation guard - skip for strings
if (!isNumeric) return;

// Numeric animation
const increment = (statistic.value as number) / steps;
// ... animation logic
```
