# Conclusion

This technical architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for the Tongmyong University website redesign project. The architecture prioritizes:

1. **Performance**: Core Web Vitals optimization, efficient caching, and modern build tools
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with comprehensive testing
3. **Scalability**: Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
4. **Maintainability**: TypeScript, comprehensive testing, and clear documentation
5. **User Experience**: Responsive design, internationalization, and modern interactions
6. **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling, automated workflows, and clear patterns

The architecture supports all requirements outlined in the PRD while providing flexibility for future enhancements and maintenance.

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up development environment using this architecture
2. Begin implementation with Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
3. Establish CI/CD pipeline and deployment workflow
4. Implement comprehensive testing strategy
5. Set up monitoring and analytics for production environment
