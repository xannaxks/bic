## Background Context
Tongmyong University's current English website suffers from an outdated design that relies heavily on video content, resulting in poor performance and user experience. The existing site lacks modern web standards, accessibility features, and mobile responsiveness, creating barriers for prospective international students and other key stakeholders.

This redesign project aims to transform the university's digital presence by implementing a modern, clean design that prioritizes user experience, accessibility, and performance. The new website will serve as the primary digital gateway for international engagement, supporting the university's growth objectives and reputation in the global education market.
