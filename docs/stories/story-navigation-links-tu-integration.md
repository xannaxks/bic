## Technical Implementation

### File to Modify
```
lib/constants/navigation.ts
```

### URL Pattern Specification
```
Base: https://www.tu.ac.kr/english/
Pattern: sub{section}_{position}.do

Format:
- section: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 (zero-padded)

### Code Changes

Only one file needs modification:

**File**: `lib/constants/navigation.ts`
**Changes**: Update all `href` values (37 total)
**Type**: Simple string replacement
**Impact**: Propagates to desktop and mobile navigation automatically

## Testing Strategy

### Link Format Verification (37 tests)
- Verify each URL follows pattern: `https://www.tu.ac.kr/english/sub{XX}_{YY}.do`
- Check section numbers: 01-05
- Check position numbers are sequential
- Validate zero-padding (01 not 1)

### Navigation Functionality (Desktop)
- All 5 sections display correctly
- Hover states work
- Links are clickable
- Correct URLs in browser status bar
- Desktop mega menu functions

### Navigation Functionality (Mobile)
- All 5 accordion sections work
- Links are clickable (44px+ touch targets)
- Accordion animations work
- Mobile menu closes on link click
- Correct URLs displayed

### Build Verification
- TypeScript compilation succeeds
- No ESLint errors
- Build completes successfully
- No runtime errors

### Integration Testing
- Desktop navigation integration
- Mobile navigation integration
- Theme switching works
- No regression in existing features

## Definition of Done
- [x] All 37 URLs updated correctly
- [x] URL pattern verified (format check)
- [x] Code implemented in navigation.ts
- [x] Self-reviewed and follows best practices
- [x] Build passes without errors
- [x] Desktop navigation tested
- [x] Mobile navigation tested
- [x] Link verification completed
- [x] QA approved
- [ ] Code deployed (ready for deployment)

## Dependencies
- Existing navigation constants structure
- Desktop navigation component
- Mobile navigation component
- Shared navigation data architecture

## Risks
- **Risk**: TU website URLs may change in future
  - **Mitigation**: Centralized in single file, easy to update
- **Risk**: Some TU pages may not exist
  - **Mitigation**: Link verification testing will identify
- **Risk**: External links may affect SEO
  - **Mitigation**: Not a concern for navigation links

## Notes
- All links point to external TU website
- Single source of truth maintained
- No UI/UX changes to navigation
- Zero-padded format required (sub01_01 not sub1_1)
- Easy to maintain and update in future
