*Validated by Product Owner on 2025-01-12*
*Development completed on 2025-09-12*

## Story
**As a** prospective student or parent,
**I want** to see credible statistics about the university's success and reputation,
**so that** I can trust the institution and feel confident about choosing it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Trust signals section displays four key statistics: student count (15,000+), ranking (#1 in Busan), international presence (45+ countries), employment rate (95%)
2. Animated progress bars grow from 0 to target percentage when section enters viewport
3. Animation triggers only once per page load using intersection observer
4. Statistics display with proper formatting and visual hierarchy
5. Icons or visual elements enhance each statistic's presentation
6. Responsive layout: 4-column (desktop), 2x2 grid (tablet), single column (mobile)
7. Animation duration and easing curves match design specifications (2s cubic-bezier)
8. Accessibility considerations include reduced motion support
9. Statistics are easily updatable through content management system
10. Performance optimized to avoid layout shift during animation

## Dev Notes

### Trust Signals Architecture
**Component Structure** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]:
```
components/sections/TrustSignals/
├── TrustSignals.tsx          # Main container component
├── StatisticCard.tsx         # Individual statistic display
├── AnimatedBar.tsx           # Progress bar animation
└── hooks/
    └── useIntersectionObserver.ts # Animation trigger hook
```

**Statistics Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface Statistic {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  value: number;
  suffix?: string;
  prefix?: string;
  percentage: number;
  icon: LucideIcon;
  color: string;
}
```

### Animation Implementation
**Progress Bar Animation** [Source: UX documentation]:
- Duration: 2 seconds with cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Bars grow from 0 to target percentage
- Smooth easing with proper timing
- One-time trigger using intersection observer

**CSS Animation Specifications**:
```css
.animated-bar {
  width: 0;
  height: 8px;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--primary), var(--secondary));
  transition: width 2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  border-radius: var(--radius-full);
}

.animated-bar.animate {
  width: var(--target-width);
}
```

### Intersection Observer Implementation
**Viewport Animation Trigger** [Source: architecture/performance-architecture.md]:
```typescript
const useIntersectionObserver = (threshold = 0.5) => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
  const [hasAnimated, setHasAnimated] = useState(false);
  const elementRef = useRef<HTMLElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting && !hasAnimated) {
          setIsVisible(true);
          setHasAnimated(true);
        }
      },
      { threshold }
    );

    if (elementRef.current) {
      observer.observe(elementRef.current);
    }

    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, [threshold, hasAnimated]);

  return { elementRef, isVisible };
};
```

### Statistics Configuration
**University Statistics** [Source: UX documentation]:
```typescript
const statistics = [
  {
    id: 'students',
    label: 'Students',
    value: 15000,
    suffix: '+',
    percentage: 85,
    icon: Users,
    color: 'text-primary'
  },
  {
    id: 'ranking',
    label: 'Ranking in Busan',
    value: 1,
    prefix: '#',
    percentage: 100,
    icon: Trophy,
    color: 'text-secondary'
  },
  {
    id: 'countries',
    label: 'Countries',
    value: 45,
    suffix: '+',
    percentage: 75,
    icon: Globe,
    color: 'text-accent'
  },
  {
    id: 'employment',
    label: 'Employment Rate',
    value: 95,
    suffix: '%',
    percentage: 95,
    icon: Briefcase,
    color: 'text-success'
  }
];
```

### Responsive Design Implementation
**Grid Layout Strategy** [Source: architecture/accessibility-architecture.md]:
```css
.trust-signals-grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .trust-signals-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .trust-signals-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  }
}
```

### Accessibility Implementation
**Reduced Motion Support** [Source: architecture/accessibility-architecture.md]:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .animated-bar {
    transition: none;
    width: var(--target-width);
  }
}
```

**Screen Reader Support**:
- Proper ARIA labels for statistics
- Number formatting for accessibility
- Alternative text for visual elements
- Semantic HTML structure

### Performance Optimization
**Layout Shift Prevention** [Source: architecture/performance-architecture.md]:
- Fixed height containers for statistic cards
- Transform-based animations instead of layout properties
- Skeleton loading states
- Optimized re-render prevention

**Core Web Vitals Impact**:
- CLS: Fixed dimensions prevent layout shift
- LCP: Optimized rendering of statistics section
- FID: Smooth animations with CSS transforms

### Content Management Integration
**Dynamic Statistics** [Source: architecture/content-management-integration.md]:
```typescript
interface StatisticConfig {
  studentCount: number;
  ranking: number;
  countries: number;
  employmentRate: number;
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

### Testing Requirements
**Animation Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-architecture.md]:
- Intersection observer functionality
- Animation trigger and completion
- Reduced motion support
- Responsive layout behavior
- Performance impact assessment

**Accessibility Testing**:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast compliance
- Reduced motion preferences

- Each statistic includes icon, label, description, and color theming

### Animation Performance:
- Counter animations use requestAnimationFrame-style stepping
- Progress bars use CSS transitions for smooth hardware acceleration
- Intersection observer prevents animations until section is visible
- Delay staggering (200ms per card) creates pleasing sequential effect
