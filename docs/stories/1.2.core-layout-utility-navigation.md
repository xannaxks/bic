## Dev Notes

### Layout Architecture Context
**Next.js App Router Structure** [Source: architecture/file-structure-overview.md]:
```
app/
├── [locale]/          # Internationalization routing
│   ├── layout.tsx     # Locale-specific layout
│   ├── page.tsx       # Homepage
│   └── [routes]/      # Page routes
├── layout.tsx         # Root layout (this story)
├── globals.css        # Global styles
└── middleware.ts      # Locale routing middleware
```

**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/file-structure-overview.md]:
```
components/
├── ui/               # Shadcn/ui base components
├── layout/           # Layout-specific components
│   └── header/       # Header components
├── features/         # Feature-specific components
│   ├── language/     # Language switching
│   ├── theme/        # Theme management
│   └── search/       # Search functionality
└── common/           # Shared components
```

### Internationalization Implementation
**Next-intl Configuration** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#internationalization]:
- Locale-based routing with /[locale]/path structure
- Supported locales: en (English), ko (Korean), zh (Chinese)
- Language detection and fallbacks
- Message interpolation and formatting support

**Implementation Details**:
- Middleware for automatic locale detection
- Language switcher with flag icons or text labels
- Persistent language preference in localStorage
- URL structure follows /[locale]/path pattern

### Theme System Implementation
**Design System Support** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#styling-design-system]:
- Dark mode support built into Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- CSS variables for theme switching
- System theme preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- Smooth transition animations between themes

**Theme Configuration**:
- Light theme: Primary #22c55e, background #ffffff, foreground #0f172a
- Dark theme: Primary #4ade80, background #0f172a, foreground #f8fafc
- Transition duration: 0.3s for smooth switching
- LocalStorage persistence for user preference

### Responsive Design Requirements
**Breakpoint Strategy** [Source: architecture/accessibility-architecture.md]:
- Mobile: <768px (touch-first design)
- Tablet: 768px-1023px (hybrid touch/mouse)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (mouse/keyboard primary)

**Utility Navigation Responsive Behavior**:
- Mobile: Compact layout, possible collapsible elements
- Tablet: Balanced spacing, touch-friendly targets
- Desktop: Full layout with hover states

### Accessibility Implementation
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#accessibility-compliance]:
- Semantic HTML structure with proper landmarks
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Focus indicators clearly visible
- Color contrast ratios meet 4.5:1 minimum
- Screen reader compatibility

**Focus Management**:
- Skip navigation links for keyboard users
- Proper focus order through utility navigation
- Focus trapping in expanded search component
- Escape key dismissal for dropdowns

### Performance Considerations
**Optimization Requirements** [Source: architecture/performance-architecture.md]:
- Server Components for static layout structure
- Client Components only for interactive elements (theme toggle, language switcher)
- Font optimization with Inter preloading
- Minimal layout shift during theme transitions

### Testing Standards
**Component Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-architecture.md]:
- React Testing Library for component behavior testing
- Accessibility testing with @axe-core/react
- Responsive testing across all breakpoints
- Theme switching functionality validation
- Language switching state management testing

**Test File Locations**:
- __tests__/components/layout/ for layout components
- __tests__/components/features/ for feature components
- Integration tests for theme and language persistence

## QA Results

### Quality Gate Decision: ✅ PASS

**Review Date:** 2025-09-12  
**Reviewed By:** Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Risk Level:** LOW

#### Requirements Traceability
✅ **AC1: Basic layout component** - Root layout.tsx properly structured with header, main, footer  
✅ **AC2: Utility navigation bar** - UtilityNavigation component with fixed positioning implemented  
✅ **AC3: Language switcher** - Functional dropdown with EN/KO/ZH support, proper locale routing  
✅ **AC4: Theme toggle** - Working light/dark mode with system preference detection  
✅ **AC5: Search bar component** - Expandable search with proper animations and interactions  
✅ **AC6: Login button** - Styled component with proper accessibility features  
✅ **AC7: Responsive behavior** - Mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints properly handled  
✅ **AC8: Basic routing structure** - i18n routing with locale support established

#### Test Coverage Analysis
**Strengths:**
- Component unit tests cover core functionality
- Accessibility testing with proper ARIA labels
- Provider wrapping for theme and internationalization testing
- Mock implementations for Next.js navigation

**Gaps:**
- Limited integration testing across breakpoints
- No visual regression tests for responsive behavior
- Theme persistence testing not explicitly verified

#### Technical Implementation Review
**Well Implemented:**
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated feature components
- Proper use of Next.js App Router with internationalization
- Accessibility-first approach with skip links and ARIA labels
- Semantic HTML structure with proper landmarks
- Theme system with smooth transitions and system detection

**Minor Issues Found:**
- Search functionality marked as TODO (expected at this stage)
- Language switcher uses simple pathname replacement (functional but could be more robust)

#### Risk Assessment
- **Security:** LOW - No authentication or sensitive data handling
- **Performance:** LOW - Minimal client components, proper font optimization
- **Maintainability:** LOW - Well-structured component architecture
- **Accessibility:** LOW - Strong WCAG compliance implementation

#### Recommendations
1. **Priority LOW:** Implement actual search functionality in future stories
2. **Priority LOW:** Add visual regression tests for responsive breakpoints
3. **Priority LOW:** Consider using next-intl's useRouter for more robust locale switching

#### Gate Status
**APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT** - All acceptance criteria met with high-quality implementation. The layout foundation is solid and ready for subsequent feature development. Minor TODOs are expected and appropriately flagged for future implementation.
