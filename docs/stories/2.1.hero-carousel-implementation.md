## Dev Notes

### Carousel Architecture Context
**Component Structure** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]:
```
components/sections/HeroCarousel/
├── HeroCarousel.tsx          # Main carousel container
├── HeroSlide.tsx             # Individual slide component
├── CarouselControls.tsx      # Navigation arrows
└── CarouselIndicators.tsx    # Slide position indicators
```

**Client Component Requirements**:
- Interactive carousel requires 'use client' directive
- State management with useState for current slide
- useEffect for auto-advance intervals
- Event handlers for touch/swipe and keyboard navigation

### Animation and Transition Implementation
**Fade Transition Specifications** [Source: UX documentation]:
- Transition duration: 600ms with ease-in-out timing
- Opacity changes from 0 to 1 for fade effect
- Position absolute for slide overlapping
- Z-index management for proper layering

**CSS Animation Structure**:
```css
.carousel-slide {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 600ms ease-in-out;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.carousel-slide.active {
  opacity: 1;
  position: relative;
}
```

### Touch/Swipe Implementation
**Mobile Interaction Support** [Source: architecture/accessibility-architecture.md]:
- Touch event handlers for swipe detection
- Minimum swipe distance threshold (50px)
- Swipe velocity consideration for responsiveness
- Prevention of default touch behaviors

**Swipe Logic Implementation**:
- touchstart: Record initial touch position
- touchmove: Track finger movement
- touchend: Calculate distance and direction, trigger slide change

### Image Optimization Strategy
**Next.js Image Component Configuration** [Source: architecture/performance-architecture.md]:
- Priority loading for first slide (LCP optimization)
- Responsive image sizing with sizes attribute
- WebP format with JPEG fallbacks
- Proper alt text for accessibility

**Responsive Image Sizing**:
- Desktop: 1920x1080 optimized images
- Tablet: 1024x576 images
- Mobile: 768x432 images
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 maintained across all breakpoints

### Accessibility Implementation
**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** [Source: architecture/accessibility-architecture.md]:
- Carousel region with proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- Screen reader announcements for slide changes
- Focus management for interactive elements
- Reduced motion support with prefers-reduced-motion

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- Left/Right arrows: Navigate slides
- Enter/Space: Activate focused control
- Tab: Navigate through carousel controls
- Escape: Stop auto-advance if focused

### Performance Optimization
**Lazy Loading Strategy** [Source: architecture/performance-architecture.md]:
- Load only current slide image initially
- Preload adjacent slides (previous/next)
- Intersection Observer for carousel visibility
- Optimize re-renders with useMemo and useCallback

**Core Web Vitals Impact**:
- LCP: Priority loading for hero carousel first slide
- CLS: Fixed aspect ratio prevents layout shift
- FID: Optimized event handlers with throttling

### State Management
**Carousel State Structure**:
```typescript
interface CarouselState {
  currentSlide: number;
  isAutoPlaying: boolean;
  isPaused: boolean;
  slides: HeroSlide[];
}
```

**State Updates**:
- Current slide index management
- Auto-play pause/resume state
- Touch interaction state
- Slide transition state

### Content Management Integration
**Hero Slide Data Structure** [Source: architecture/content-management-integration.md]:
```typescript
interface HeroSlide {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  description?: string;
  image: {
    url: string;
    alternativeText: string;
    width: number;
    height: number;
  };
  ctaPrimary?: {
    text: string;
    url: string;
  };
  ctaSecondary?: {
    text: string;
    url: string;
  };
  order: number;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### Testing Requirements
**Component Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-architecture.md]:
- Carousel rendering and slide transitions
- Auto-advance functionality testing
- Touch/swipe gesture testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Accessibility compliance with axe-core
- Performance testing with large image sets

**Test Scenarios**:
- Slide progression and transitions
- Pause on hover behavior
- Manual navigation with arrows and indicators
- Mobile swipe functionality
- Keyboard accessibility
- Screen reader compatibility
