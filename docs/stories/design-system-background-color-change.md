*Approved for Development on 2025-01-17*

## Story

**As a** website visitor using light mode,
**I want** the background color to be the university's signature green (#005629),
**So that** the website better reflects the university's brand identity with a distinctive, professional appearance.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Design system in `app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`
- Technology: Tailwind CSS 4 with CSS custom properties (HSL color space)
- Follows pattern: Existing CSS variable pattern for theme colors
- Touch points:
  - CSS custom property `--background` in `:root` selector
  - All components using `bg-background` Tailwind class
  - Dark mode theme remains unchanged

**Current Implementation:**
- Light mode background: `--background: 0 0% 100%` (white - HSL format)
- Target color: `#005629` (dark green - HEX format)
- Need to convert: #005629 → HSL format for consistency
  - Conversion: `hsl(150, 100%, 17%)` approximately

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Light mode background color changed from white (`0 0% 100%`) to dark green (`150 100% 17%`)
2. Foreground text color adjusted for proper contrast against dark green background (WCAG AA compliance: 4.5:1 minimum)
3. All card/popover backgrounds adjusted to ensure readability on new background

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Dark mode theme colors remain completely unchanged
5. All existing components continue to render correctly with new background
6. Navigation glass morphism effect remains functional and visually appropriate
7. Footer, headers, and sections maintain visual hierarchy

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
9. All text remains readable across entire application
10. No visual regressions in existing components
11. Change is tested in both light and dark modes
12. Build succeeds without warnings

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Update `app/globals.css` line 5: `--background: 0 0% 100%` → `--background: 150 100% 17%`
- Likely need to update `--foreground` to ensure contrast: change from `222.2 84% 4.9%` (dark) to a light color
- May need to adjust `--card`, `--popover`, `--muted` colors for proper visual hierarchy
- Estimated changes: 3-5 CSS variable updates in `:root` selector

**Color Conversion Reference:**
- Original request: #005629
- HSL equivalent: `hsl(150, 100%, 17%)`
- Suggested foreground: `hsl(0, 0%, 98%)` or `hsl(150, 20%, 95%)` (light text)

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Dark mode already inverts background/foreground
- Follow same pattern: light background → dark background in light mode
- Maintain HSL format for all color values (compatible with Tailwind's color system)

**Key Constraints:**
- Must maintain WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Cannot break existing component styling
- Dark mode must remain completely unaffected
- Build must succeed without errors

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Visual inspection of all major components (navigation, hero, cards, footer)
2. Contrast checker for all text combinations
3. Test theme toggle to ensure dark mode unchanged
4. Verify glass morphism effects on navigation
5. Check mobile responsive views

## Definition of Done

- [x] Background color changed to #005629 (HSL: 150 100% 17%) in light mode
- [x] Foreground text color provides sufficient contrast (WCAG AA)
- [x] Card and popover backgrounds adjusted appropriately
- [x] All text readable throughout application
- [x] Dark mode remains unchanged and functional
- [x] Visual inspection completed for all major components
- [x] Contrast ratios verified with accessibility tools
- [x] Build succeeds without errors or warnings
- [x] Theme toggle works correctly between light/dark modes
- [x] No regression in existing functionality

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Low - Simple CSS variable change, well-isolated
**Mitigation:** Test thoroughly with contrast checker, visual inspection across all components

**Secondary Risk:** Medium - Contrast issues may require multiple color adjustments
**Mitigation:** Have backup lighter green color ready (#006633 / hsl(150, 100%, 20%)) if contrast fails

**Rollback:** Simple - revert `app/globals.css` changes to previous values

## Change Impact Analysis

**Files Modified:**
- `bic-nextjs/app/globals.css` (`:root` selector, lines 4-24 estimated)

**Files Potentially Affected:**
- All components using `bg-background` class (visual change only, no code changes needed)

**Components to Verify:**
- Navigation (utility + main)
- Hero section
- Quick actions grid
- Trust signals
- News/media cards
- Footer

## Story Metadata

**Epic:** N/A - Standalone design system update
**Story Points:** 2 (Small - single file change, thorough testing required)
**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None
**Blocked By:** None

### Implementation Details

**Color Changes Applied:**
- Background: `150 100% 17%` (dark university green #005629)
- Foreground: `0 0% 98%` (near-white for contrast)
- Card: `150 30% 25%` (lighter green for elevation)
- Popover: `150 30% 25%` (matching card)

### Completion Notes
- All color variables updated in `:root` selector only
- Dark mode theme completely unchanged (`.dark` selector untouched)
- Build successful with no errors
- All components inherit new colors via CSS variables
- Visual hierarchy maintained through lightness variations
