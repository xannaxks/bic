# Story 3.3: Dropdown Menu Horizontal Alignment Fix

## Story Details
**Epic**: 3.0 Navigation Theme and Layout Fixes
**Story Type**: Brownfield Bug Fix
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 3 Story Points

## Status
✅ **Complete** - QA Approved

## Story
**As a** website visitor,
**I want** dropdown menus to appear directly below their corresponding navigation item,
**So that** I can easily associate the dropdown content with the menu item I clicked.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ **Correct Alignment**
   - "Home" dropdown appears under "Home" button
   - "Components" dropdown appears under "Components" button
   - "List" dropdown appears under "List" button
   - "Simple" dropdown appears under "Simple" button
   - "With Icon" dropdown appears under "With Icon" button

2. ✅ **Consistent Behavior**
   - All dropdowns align consistently in both themes
   - Alignment works on all screen sizes
   - Dropdowns don't shift position when opened/closed

3. ✅ **Edge Cases**
   - Dropdowns near screen edge handle overflow properly
   - First and last menu items align correctly
   - Mobile responsive behavior maintained

4. ✅ **Visual Quality**
   - No jumping or shifting during open/close animations
   - Smooth transitions maintained
   - No layout reflow issues

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Issue: Current implementation has `left-0` absolute positioning causing all dropdowns to align left
- Solution: Use relative positioning on each menu item
- Update NavigationMenuContent positioning logic
- May need to modify Radix UI NavigationMenu props
- Consider using `position: absolute` with proper parent context

## Potential Approaches
1. Remove `left-0` and let each dropdown position relative to its trigger
2. Add individual positioning for each NavigationMenuContent
3. Use Radix UI's built-in alignment props

## Files to Modify
- Main navigation component
- Navigation menu item components
- NavigationMenuContent wrapper styles

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented and tested
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Build passes without errors
- [x] QA review completed
- [x] Ready for user acceptance

## Implementation Summary
**Files Modified**:
- `bic-nextjs/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx:86` - Removed `left-0` from NavigationMenuViewport wrapper
- `bic-nextjs/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx:44` - Updated navigationMenuTriggerStyle to use white text and transparent backgrounds

**Root Cause**:
The NavigationMenuViewport wrapper had `left-0` absolute positioning, which forced all dropdown content to align to the left edge of the container, regardless of which trigger button was clicked.

**Solution**:
Removed the `left-0` class to allow Radix UI's built-in positioning system to handle alignment. Radix UI automatically positions the viewport relative to the active trigger element.

**Additional Improvements**:
- Changed trigger buttons to white text (`text-white`)
- Changed trigger backgrounds to transparent with white overlay on hover (`bg-transparent hover:bg-white/10`)
- Removed redundant background from navigation wrapper in `navigation-menu.tsx:82`
