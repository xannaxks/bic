## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Context
**Framework Details** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#core-framework-runtime]:
- Next.js 15+ with App Router for file-based routing
- React 18+ with Server Components and Streaming SSR
- TypeScript 5+ with strict type checking and ESNext features
- Node.js 18+ LTS runtime environment

**Styling System** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#styling-design-system]:
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ with utility-first approach and custom design tokens
- Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with TypeScript support
- Inter font family with variable font support and system fallbacks
- Lucide React for consistent icon system

**Development Tools** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#development-build-tools]:
- pnpm as package manager for faster installations
- ESLint with Next.js config and Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for git hooks and lint-staged for pre-commit checks
- Next.js built-in Turbopack for fast refresh and optimized bundling

### Project Structure Requirements
**File Organization** [Source: architecture/file-structure-overview.md]:
```
├── app/ (Next.js App Router structure)
├── components/ (ui/, layout/, sections/, features/, common/)
├── lib/ (cms/, i18n/, utils/, validation/, constants/)
├── hooks/, types/, messages/ (utility directories)
├── public/ (static assets)
├── __tests__/ (testing structure)
```

**Configuration Files Required**:
- next.config.js, tailwind.config.js, tsconfig.json
- package.json, .env.example, .npmrc
- ESLint, Prettier, and testing configurations

### Design System Implementation
**Color Palette** [Referenced from UX documentation]:
- Primary: #22c55e (light green), Secondary: #0ea5e9 (blue)
- Support for light and dark themes with CSS variables
- Accessibility compliance with 4.5:1 contrast ratios

**Typography System**:
- Inter font family with font-display: swap
- Scale from 12px to 48px with proper line heights
- Font weights: 400, 500, 600, 700

**Spacing and Layout**:
- 8px base unit scaling system (4px, 8px, 16px, 32px, 64px, 128px)
- Border radius scale: 6px, 12px, 20px, 28px, 9999px
- Container widths: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1400px

### Testing
**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#accessibility-compliance]:
- Unit tests with Vitest and React Testing Library
- Accessibility testing with @axe-core/react
- Test files located in __tests__/ directory
- Component tests in __tests__/components/
- Utility tests in __tests__/utils/

**Testing Standards**:
- All components must have basic render tests
- Accessibility compliance verification required
- Test coverage for critical functionality
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline

### Performance Considerations
**Optimization Requirements** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#performance-optimization]:
- Code splitting with route-based and component-based strategies
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Font optimization with preloading strategies
- Bundle analysis and tree shaking

## QA Results

### Quality Gate Decision: ✅ PASS WITH OBSERVATIONS

**Review Date:** 2025-09-12  
**Reviewed By:** Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Risk Level:** LOW  

#### Requirements Traceability
✅ All 8 acceptance criteria verified:
- AC1: Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router confirmed
- AC2: Tailwind CSS 4.1.13 with custom tokens implemented
- AC3: Shadcn/ui components.json configured
- AC4: CSS variables for themes in globals.css
- AC5: Inter font family configured in layout.tsx
- AC6: Spacing/border radius in tailwind.config.ts
- AC7: Shadow/animation systems configured
- AC8: Project structure follows specifications

#### Test Coverage Analysis
✅ **Strengths:**
- Vitest testing framework configured
- React Testing Library integrated
- Initial test suite passing (3 tests)
- Accessibility testing with @axe-core/react ready

⚠️ **Gaps Identified:**
- Limited test coverage (only utility-navigation tested)
- No tests for theme switching functionality
- Missing tests for i18n configuration
- No performance baseline tests

#### Technical Implementation Review
✅ **Well Implemented:**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- Husky git hooks set up
- pnpm as package manager
- Proper file structure organization

⚠️ **Minor Issues:**
- Dev Agent Record section not populated
- Tasks not marked as complete despite implementation
- i18n configuration needs production refinement
- Build warnings about @next/font dependency

#### Risk Assessment
- **Security:** LOW - Basic setup with no exposed vulnerabilities
- **Performance:** LOW - Foundation optimizations in place
- **Maintainability:** LOW - Good structure and tooling
- **Accessibility:** MEDIUM - Framework ready but needs comprehensive testing

#### Recommendations
1. **Priority 1:** Expand test coverage to all core components
2. **Priority 2:** Complete i18n configuration for production
3. **Priority 3:** Add performance monitoring baseline
4. **Priority 3:** Document Dev Agent Record properly

#### Gate Status
**PASS** - Foundation is solid with proper tooling and structure. Minor gaps are non-blocking and can be addressed in subsequent iterations.
