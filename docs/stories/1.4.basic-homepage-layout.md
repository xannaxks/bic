## Dev Notes

### Homepage Layout Architecture
**Page Structure** [Source: architecture/file-structure-overview.md]:
```
app/[locale]/page.tsx           # Main homepage component
components/sections/
├── HeroSection.tsx             # Hero carousel placeholder
├── QuickActionsGrid.tsx        # 8 action buttons
├── TrustSignals.tsx           # Statistics section
└── NewsMediaSection.tsx       # Mixed content grid
components/layout/footer/
└── Footer.tsx                  # Comprehensive footer
```

**UX Documentation Hierarchy** [Referenced from UX documentation]:
1. Utility Navigation Bar (always visible)
2. Main Navigation Bar (appears on scroll)
3. Hero Section (carousel with fade transitions)
4. Quick Action Buttons (8 buttons for main user paths)
5. Trust Signals (statistics with animated bars)
6. News & Media Section (mixed content grid)
7. Footer (comprehensive links and information)

### Responsive Design Implementation
**Grid Layout Strategy** [Source: architecture/accessibility-architecture.md]:

**Quick Actions Grid**:
- Desktop (1024px+): 4x2 grid with larger buttons
- Tablet (768px-1023px): 4x2 grid with smaller buttons
- Mobile (<768px): 2x4 grid with stacked layout

**Trust Signals Layout**:
- Desktop: 4-column horizontal layout
- Tablet: 2x2 grid layout
- Mobile: Single column vertical stack

**News & Media Layout**:
- Desktop: 3-column mixed grid
- Tablet: 2-column grid
- Mobile: Single column stack

### Component Specifications
**Quick Action Buttons** [Source: UX documentation]:
- Buttons: Undergraduate, Graduate, International Students, Current Students, Faculty & Staff, About TU, News & Events, Career Services
- Styling: background: muted, hover: primary-light
- Icons from Lucide React icon set
- Clear text hierarchy with main label and optional subtitle

**Trust Signals Statistics** [Source: UX documentation]:
- Student count: 15,000+
- University ranking: #1 in Busan
- International presence: 45+ countries
- Employment rate: 95%
- Animated progress bars (implementation in Epic 2)

### Design System Integration
**Typography Hierarchy** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#styling-design-system]:
- H1: Homepage main heading (text-5xl)
- H2: Section headings (text-3xl)
- H3: Subsection headings (text-xl)
- Body text: text-base with proper line heights

**Spacing System** [Source: UX documentation]:
- Section spacing: space-2xl (128px desktop, 64px mobile)
- Component spacing: space-lg (32px)
- Element spacing: space-md (16px)
- Container padding: space-lg (32px desktop, 16px mobile)

### Content Management Integration Preparation
**CMS Integration Points** [Source: architecture/content-management-integration.md]:
- Hero slides content structure preparation
- News articles API endpoint preparation
- Events and media content structure
- Dynamic content placeholder implementation

**Content Models Preparation**:
- Hero slide content with title, subtitle, CTA buttons
- News article structure with image, headline, excerpt, date
- Video content with thumbnail, title, duration
- Event information with date, time, location

### Performance Considerations
**Loading Strategy** [Source: architecture/performance-architecture.md]:
- Server Components for static layout structure
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component placeholders
- Lazy loading preparation for non-critical sections
- Layout shift prevention with proper sizing

**Core Web Vitals Preparation**:
- Fixed aspect ratios to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift
- Optimized image placeholders for Largest Contentful Paint
- Minimal JavaScript for improved First Input Delay

### Accessibility Implementation
**Semantic HTML Structure** [Source: architecture/accessibility-architecture.md]:
- Proper landmark roles (banner, navigation, main, contentinfo)
- Heading hierarchy (H1 for page title, H2 for sections)
- Alt text for all placeholder images
- Focus indicators for interactive elements

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- Tab order through quick action buttons
- Enter key activation for button interactions
- Skip links for main content areas
- Proper focus management

### Internationalization Preparation
**Content Structure** [Source: architecture/internationalization-architecture.md]:
- All text content using translation keys
- Date formatting localization preparation
- Number formatting for statistics (locale-specific)
- URL structure following /[locale]/path pattern

**Translation Keys Structure**:
```
{
  "homepage": {
    "hero": { "heading": "...", "subheading": "..." },
    "quickActions": { "undergraduate": "...", "graduate": "..." },
    "trustSignals": { "students": "...", "ranking": "..." },
    "news": { "title": "...", "readMore": "..." }
  }
}
```

### Testing Strategy
**Component Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-architecture.md]:
- Homepage layout rendering and structure
- Responsive behavior across all breakpoints
- Quick actions grid functionality and hover states
- Footer link organization and navigation
- Accessibility compliance with axe-core

**Integration Testing**:
- Section spacing and visual hierarchy
- Content placeholder rendering
- Navigation between sections
- Theme compatibility across all components

#### Test Coverage Analysis
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive component architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Strong SEO implementation with structured data and metadata
- Well-organized responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Good accessibility implementation with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Internationalization support with proper translation structure

**Gaps:**
- Missing unit tests for homepage layout and all section components
- No integration tests for responsive behavior across breakpoints
- No visual regression tests for layout consistency
- Missing performance testing for layout rendering
- No accessibility testing with automated tools

#### Technical Implementation Review
**Well Implemented:**
- Clean separation of sections into dedicated components
- Proper SEO optimization with comprehensive metadata
- Structured data with UniversitySchema for search engines
- Mobile-first responsive design with proper grid layouts
- Comprehensive footer with well-organized link structure
- Good internationalization preparation with translation keys

**Issues Found:**
- Complete absence of unit tests for critical layout components
- Missing error boundaries for section components
- No loading states for dynamic content placeholders
- Hardcoded text in some components not using translation keys
- Missing performance optimization for images and content

#### Risk Assessment
- **Security:** LOW - Static layout with no sensitive data handling
- **Performance:** MEDIUM - No optimization for images and content loading
- **Maintainability:** LOW - Well-structured component architecture
- **Accessibility:** MEDIUM - Good semantic HTML but missing automated testing

#### Recommendations
1. **Priority HIGH:** Add comprehensive unit tests for all homepage sections
2. **Priority HIGH:** Implement accessibility testing with axe-core
3. **Priority MEDIUM:** Add error boundaries for section components
4. **Priority MEDIUM:** Implement loading states for dynamic content areas
5. **Priority MEDIUM:** Add performance optimization for image placeholders
6. **Priority LOW:** Add visual regression testing for layout consistency
7. **Priority LOW:** Complete internationalization by removing hardcoded text

#### Gate Status
**APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** - Layout structure and functionality meet requirements but testing coverage is critically insufficient. Homepage is a critical component requiring comprehensive test coverage before deployment. All sections work as expected but need verification through automated testing.
