  observations:
    - Limited test coverage (only utility-navigation tested)
    - Dev Agent Record section not populated
    - i18n configuration needs production refinement
    - Build warnings about @next/font dependency

recommendations:
  priority_1:
    - Expand test coverage to all core components
  priority_2:
    - Complete i18n configuration for production
  priority_3:
    - Add performance monitoring baseline
    - Document Dev Agent Record properly

notes: |
  Foundation implementation is solid with proper tooling and structure.
  The project setup provides a strong base for further development.
  Minor gaps identified are non-blocking and can be addressed iteratively.
