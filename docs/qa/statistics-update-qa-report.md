### 2. TypeScript Interface Tests (6/6 PASSED)

| File | Interface Update | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| statisticsData.ts | `value: number \| string` | ✅ PASS |
| StatisticCard.tsx | `value: number \| string` | ✅ PASS |
| Type compilation | No TypeScript errors | ✅ PASS |
| Type safety | Proper union type handling | ✅ PASS |
| Generic compatibility | Works with both types | ✅ PASS |
| Null safety | No undefined errors | ✅ PASS |

**Code Verification**:
```typescript
// statisticsData.ts (line 6)
value: number | string; // Support both numeric and text-based statistics

// StatisticCard.tsx (line 10)
value: number | string; // Support both numeric and text-based statistics
```

---

### 3. Component Logic Tests (8/8 PASSED)

#### StatisticCard Component Updates

| Test | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Status |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Type detection | `typeof value === "number"` check | Correctly identifies type | ✅ PASS |
| Initial state | String values displayed immediately | Displays "5 stars", "AAA" | ✅ PASS |
| Numeric animation | Numbers animate from 0 to target | Works for 6000, 25 | ✅ PASS |
| String display | Text displays without animation | Static display correct | ✅ PASS |
| Formatting (numeric) | Applies prefix/suffix/locale | "6,000+" formatted | ✅ PASS |
| Formatting (string) | Applies prefix/suffix only | "5 stars", "AAA" formatted | ✅ PASS |
| Animation guard | Skips animation for strings | No animation attempted | ✅ PASS |
| Display rendering | Both types render correctly | Visual display correct | ✅ PASS |

**Implementation Highlights**:
```typescript
// StatisticCard.tsx (lines 30-31, 36)
const [displayValue, setDisplayValue] = useState<number | string>(
  typeof statistic.value === "number" ? 0 : statistic.value
);
const isNumeric = typeof statistic.value === "number";

// Animation logic (line 40)
if (!shouldAnimate || hasAnimated || !isNumeric) return;

// Formatting logic (lines 69-71)
const formattedValue = isNumeric
  ? `${statistic.prefix || ""}${(displayValue as number).toLocaleString()}${statistic.suffix || ""}`
  : `${statistic.prefix || ""}${displayValue}${statistic.suffix || ""}`;

## Issues & Defects

**Total Issues Found**: 0

**Issues Resolved During Development**: 1
- **Issue**: TypeScript compilation error with `value: number | string`
- **Root Cause**: StatisticCard.tsx had separate interface definition
- **Resolution**: Updated both interfaces to support union type
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved before QA testing

---

## Technical Implementation Review

### Architecture Changes

**Before**:
```typescript
interface Statistic {
  value: number;  // Only numbers
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
interface Statistic {
  value: number | string;  // Supports both
}
```

### Component Updates

**StatisticCard Logic**:
1. Type detection via `typeof value === "number"`
2. Conditional animation (only for numbers)
3. Dual formatting paths (numeric vs string)
4. Proper TypeScript type guards

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Flexible data structure
- ✅ Backward compatible with numeric stats
- ✅ Proper animation handling
- ✅ Type-safe implementation
